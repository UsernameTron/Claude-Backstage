# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-01)

**Core value:** Every package maps directly to a real Claude Code subsystem with exact source paths and type signatures
**Current focus:** Phase 03 — extract-tier-completion

## Current Position

Phase: 4
Plan: Not started
Status: Phase 03 complete, ready for Phase 04
Last activity: 2026-04-02

Progress: [██████░░░░] 64%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: Option B (Tiered packages/) selected over Flat and Domain options — 1:1 KB v2.1 mapping, best discoverability
- [Init]: tsconfig extends over project references — no build step means no incremental benefit
- [Init]: Bun over npm/yarn/pnpm — native TS support, faster installs, workspace protocol
- [Phase 01]: CLAUDE.md verified at 2140 chars, under 2K token budget
- [Phase 01]: TypeScript v6 rejects empty files/include arrays — used anchor .ts file for tsconfig validation
- [Phase 01]: Path-based Makefile type-check confirmed as correct approach per bun --filter scoped package limitation
- [Phase 02]: Used setuptools.build_meta instead of legacy backend for Python 3.14 compatibility
- [Phase 02]: Fixed tsconfig extends to ../../../tsconfig.base.json for build-tier 3-level nesting
- [Phase 03]: Followed established 4-file scaffold pattern from Phase 02 for all 9 standalone extract packages
- [Phase 03]: Cross-package imports use `import type` for type-only and value imports for re-exported constants

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Bun `--filter '*'` does not match scoped `@claude-patterns/` packages — use path-based filtering in Makefile
